# Social Media Automation – Architecture Overview

## Overview
This repository documents the **architecture and design approach** used in a real-world social media automation system built using **n8n**.

The actual workflow and credentials are not included to respect client confidentiality and NDAs.

## System Highlights
- Event-driven automation design
- Secure API integration patterns
- Environment-variable–based configuration
- Error handling and retry strategy
- Scalable workflow architecture

## Architecture
The system follows a modular automation pattern:

Trigger → Validation → API Integration → Error Handling → Logging

## Included Artifacts
- High-level architecture diagram
- Blurred workflow screenshots
- Design notes explaining decisions

## Excluded (Intentionally)
- Workflow JSON
- API keys or tokens
- Webhook URLs
- Client-specific logic

## Purpose
This repository is intended to:
- Demonstrate automation system design
- Showcase production-level thinking
- Support portfolio and interview discussions

## Tools & Technologies
- n8n
- REST APIs
- Automation best practices

## Disclaimer
This is an **architecture showcase**, not an executable project.
